## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

the diffrence is that the 'Stack' going on 'LIFO' way 'last in first out' and that mean is the first item enter to array must be the first element will exit from it , put the 'Queue' going on 'FIFO' way 'first in first out' and that mean the items will exit in same way that it enter to the array.

Examples :

Stack : may recursion is one of stack algorithem becuase when function will execute all the function will stay to get valu from this function.

Queue : print queue is the most nice example for 'Queue'. All the print order will go to the printer in sequential ordering
